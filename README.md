General guidelines for End-term/Final exam project:

We will not have a final exam as described in the syllabus. Instead, the final evaluation consists of an end-term project that will be defended by the corresponding student group (3 to 4 students per project). The final evaluation deliverable consists of a report, code, and a short 5 to 10-minute pre-recorded video of the project. The report is due on 05/04 at 11:59 pm (two days before our final exam/project presentation date ). Submissions should be done via brightspace as a .zip file.

A final report (in digital form) for the project should include:

Introduction: A general description of the area of your project and why you're doing it.
Group member work distribution: Who did what and what percentage of the project such effort represented.
Problem Specification: A clear and succinct technical description of the problem you're addressing. Formulating a general problem (e.g., transcribing music) into a well-defined technical goal (e.g., reporting a list of estimated fundamental periods at each time frame) is often the most important part of a project. How is DSP involved in the problem/topic you are dealing with? Why is DSP relevant in the description/solution/development of your project?
Data: What are the real-world and/or synthetic signals you are going to use to develop and evaluate your work?
Evaluation Criteria: How are you going to measure how well your project performs? The best criteria are objective, quantitative, and discriminatory. You want to be able to demonstrate and measure improvements in your system.
Approach: A description of how you went about trying to solve the problem. Sometimes you can make a nice project by contrasting two or more different approaches (you don't have to implement several approaches).
Results and Analysis: What happened when you evaluated your system using the data and criteria introduced above? What issues did you find while implementing your project? (This may require you to choose or synthesize data that will reveal these shortcomings.) Your analysis of what happened is one of the most important opportunities to display your command of signal-processing concepts.
Development: If possible, you will come up with ideas about how to improve the shortcomings identified in the previous section, and then implement and evaluate them. Did they, in fact, help? Were there unexpected side effects?
Conclusions: What did you learn from doing the project? What did you demonstrate about how to solve your problem?
References: Complete list of sources you used in completing your project, with explanations of what you got from each.
Code: Provide your code (zip or print the relevant parts) or describe how it performs the tasks involved in your code.
You can consider the above points as tentative sections for your report (no report is equal). I strongly recommend you do your project in Matlab because it frees you from many of the low-level details. However, you are free to use any language or system for which you feel more comfortable with. Presentation of the projects will be done 05/06 in Lafayette L212.
Presentation guidelines:

The presentation should not exceed 15 minutes (with 2 to 5 minutes for questions).
Assume, as a rule of thumb, 1 minute per slide.
If possible motivate your work with a simple and quick demo.
Tell us quickly and succinctly what is the problem/topic you are addressing and how DSP is used to solve or study the problem/topic.
Why should we care about it? How did you address the problem?
Mention what were the main challenges to achieve the goal of your project.
Provide conclusions and what future directions can be taken to learn and advance the topic of your project.
Remember you are only giving your peers a high-level (understandable) view of your work. So treat it as a "commercial" or "advertisement" for your work.
Following and/or answering these points (extracting information directly from your report) will help you finish your slides very quickly.

Also, consider the following as the main grading areas:

Report (grading done by instructor)
1. Problem Statement
2. Study and documentation of literature on the topic
3. Relationship of the project to DSP. Need to be properly stated in terms clear to the reader.
4. Report quality (writing style, grammar, organization). Is the report appropriately sectioned? Does the technique described to solve the problem (or describe the topic of interest) sound?
5. Figures and tables clarity
6. Referencing
Presentation (peer graded - 3: excellent, 2: good, 1: average, 0:bad )
1. Technical content and relationship to DSP
2. Oral exposition, explanation, and organization of subject matter
3. Quality and contents of visual materials (handouts are a plus)
4. Pacing, adherence to time limit, and Q&A handling (if any)
I look forward to seeing your work on 05/06!

P.S.: Please have your group decided by the middle of the 3rd week of March, so that you can discuss/decide your project. Otherwise, set an appointment with me to help you pick an achievable project.
